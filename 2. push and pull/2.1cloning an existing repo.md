Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to clone a GitHub repository to your local machine, make changes, and then push those changes back to GitHub.

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
   - **Open Terminal:** 
     - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - **Navigate to the Directory:**
     - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command:
       ```bash
       cd /path/to/your/directory
       ```
   - **Clone the Repository:**
     - Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL. You can find the URL on the repository page on GitHub under the "Code" button.
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
       ```
     - Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository-name` with the name of the repository.
