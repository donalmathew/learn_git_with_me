If you've recently changed your GitHub username, you'll need to update the SSH remote URL for your repositories to reflect the new username. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Steps to Update SSH URL

1. **Check the Current Remote URL:**
   - Navigate to your repository and check the current remote URL with the following command:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
   - You should see something like this:
     ```
     origin  git@github.com:old-username/repo-name.git (fetch)
     origin  git@github.com:old-username/repo-name.git (push)
     ```

2. **Update the Remote URL:**
   - Use the `git remote set-url` command to update the URL with your new GitHub username:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:new-username/repo-name.git
     ```
   - Replace `new-username` with your new GitHub username and `repo-name` with the repository name.

3. **Verify the Change:**
   - Check if the remote URL has been updated correctly:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
   - It should now show:
     ```
     origin  git@github.com:new-username/repo-name.git (fetch)
     origin  git@github.com:new-username/repo-name.git (push)
     ```

4. **Test the Connection:**
   - You can test the SSH connection to GitHub with:
     ```bash
     ssh -T git@github.com
     ```
   - You should see a message like:
     ```
     Hi new-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
     ```

This updates the SSH address for the local repository, allowing you to continue pushing and pulling without issues after changing your GitHub username.
